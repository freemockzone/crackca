This upgrade is a major milestone in India’s efforts to enhance payload capacity and reduce launch costs. The new semi-cryogenic stage will use a more powerful indigenously developed SE2000 engine, burning refined kerosene (RP-1) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX). This development is crucial for India’s heavy-lift space missions, commercial launches, and future programs like Gaganyaan, positioning the country more competitively in the global space market.",

Between 2018-2023, there were 687 custodial deaths, with Gujarat (81) and Maharashtra (80) leading. Reasons for torture include lack of training, pressure for quick results, poor infrastructure, societal tolerance, weak accountability, and targeting of vulnerable groups. India lacks a standalone anti-torture law and has not ratified the UN Convention Against Torture, leading to a 'high-risk' ranking in the Global Torture Index (2025).

    "summary": "The U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff plus an unspecified 'penalty' on Indian imports, effective August 1, 2025. This decision, superseding an earlier 26% tariff threat, cites India's energy and defense purchases from Russia, high tariffs on U.S. goods, and 'strenuous and obnoxious' non-monetary trade barriers. The Indian Ministry of Commerce is studying the implications and vows to protect national interests, particularly those of farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. This move comes amidst ongoing bilateral trade agreement talks and a failed 'mini-deal' attempt, signaling diplomatic strain and potential economic repercussions for India's export sectors. The background includes Trump's 'Liberation Day Tariffs' and U.S. criticism of India's ties with Russia over the Ukraine conflict. India plans to evaluate impacts, potentially seek WTO redress or bilateral de-escalation, and continue working towards a mutually beneficial trade agreement. This issue is highly relevant for UPSC Mains GS Paper 2 (India-USA Relations, International Trade Policies, Diplomacy) and GS Paper 3 (Effects of Liberalization, Trade Agreements, MSME Sector Challenges).",

This joint venture between ISRO and NASA is the first of its kind, aiming to provide high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night data on Earth's surface for five years. NISAR will be crucial for monitoring natural disasters, improving crop output, and understanding environmental changes like ground deformation, ice sheet movement, and vegetation dynamics. The GSLV-F16 rocket precisely injected the 2,392 kg satellite into a sun-synchronous orbit. The mission utilizes a dual-frequency SAR (L-band by NASA, S-band by ISRO) and a 12-meter unfurlable mesh reflector antenna. Key phases include launch, deployment of the antenna (starting 10 days post-launch), and commissioning, followed by the science phase. This launch also marks the first time a GSLV has placed a satellite into a sun-synchronous polar orbit.",
