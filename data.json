The Court directed the Speaker to decide the petitions within three months, emphasizing that such delays undermine the integrity of the Speaker's office and the purpose of the Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law). The ruling reinforces that the Speaker's role, while acting as a tribunal, is not immune from judicial review and must be exercised expeditiously to prevent political opportunism. The decision sets a crucial precedent for Speakers across India to ensure timely resolution of defection cases, thereby strengthening the democratic process and political accountability.",

    "summary": "This note analyzes the recent strain in India-US relations under the Trump administration, characterized by President Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on India and his public criticism of its economy. The conflict is rooted in India's ties with Russia and its significant trade surplus with the US. While India's Commerce Minister counters with a 'bright spot' narrative and a focus on domestic growth, the US is also imposing penalties on India's energy trade with Russia and Iran. A major geopolitical shift is highlighted by the US-Pakistan trade deal, which signals a new era of cooperation and a potential realignment of US foreign policy in the region. This development underscores the need for India to diversify its trade relations and adapt its diplomatic strategy to a highly personalized and transactional global environment.",

    "summary": "Under the Trump administration, India has been hit with a 25% tariff on its goods, a move that followed a perceived strategic miscalculation by the Modi government. While other countries like the EU and Japan negotiated more lenient terms, India's diplomacy was seen as unprepared for Trump's transactional style. The situation was complicated by Trump's public claim of credit for the 'Operation Sindoor' ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The article suggests that Indian foreign policy failed to adapt to the personalized diplomacy of the era and highlights the need for a more flexible yet principled approach to international relations.

Economic institutions like ANZ, HSBC, and Nomura have revised down their GDP growth forecasts for FY 2025-26, with potential impacts ranging from 20 to 40 basis points. This could push India's growth below 6%. Key Indian exports to the US, such as electronics, gems, and textiles, are expected to be hit, with estimated export losses of up to $33 billion. Despite low inflation, the RBI's ability to provide further monetary stimulus is seen as limited. While India's domestic demand provides a buffer, the tariff shock highlights the need for export market diversification and a recalibrated trade strategy.

It contrasts the 'Dirty Harry' (coercive, rule-breaking) policing model with the 'Sherlock Holmes' (evidence-driven, lawful) model. Between 2018-2023, there were 687 custodial deaths, with Gujarat (81) and Maharashtra (80) leading. Reasons for torture include lack of training, pressure for quick results, poor infrastructure, societal tolerance, weak accountability, and targeting of vulnerable groups. India lacks a standalone anti-torture law and has not ratified the UN Convention Against Torture, leading to a 'high-risk' ranking in the Global Torture Index (2025). Scientific evidence from experts like Shane O'Mara and examples from the Innocence Project (USA) demonstrate torture's ineffectiveness, often leading to false confessions. Effective, non-coercive methods like the UK's PEACE model are recommended. Key recommendations include ratifying the UN Convention, enacting an anti-torture law, adopting the PEACE model, improving training/infrastructure, and ensuring strict accountability.

While official economic data often overlooks climate-related impacts, this editorial from The Hindu highlights the urgent need for India to integrate climate attribution into its economic reporting, citing global best practices and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events. Despite the overall slowdown, sectors like capital goods, intermediate goods, and infrastructure goods showed resilience, indicating the positive impact of government spending. The article emphasizes the importance of data transparency and institutional accountability to build resilient economic systems.",

        "summary": "The Assam government initiated an eviction drive in Rengma Reserve Forest, Golaghat district, targeting 11,000 bighas (~3,600 acres) of encroached forest land along the Assam-Nagaland border. The drive, launched after CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's visit, involved heavy machinery and personnel to demolish structures, with over 20% of the land cleared in Phase I. Most encroachers, primarily migrant Muslims, had already vacated after notices. While CM Sarma emphasized the need to curb encroachment and demographic alteration, the NSCN (Niki Sumi faction) condemned it as a 'land grab' targeting Naga territories. The action highlights issues of forest conservation, inter-state boundary disputes, and the balance between environmental protection and human settlement.",
